# corsi_calc

## To-Do
- Use /linescore to fill out the results in Schedule table.
    - Finish Schedule update
- Change GetSchedule to use a pointer to a schedule instead of returning a schedule.
- Use /boxscore to calculate Corsi
    - Output results (times team with the better corse won/lost)
- Multiple years, instead of just 2019-20
- Maybe move some of the functions in hockeydb.go into their own files.
